# Blackbox Optimizer
Optimizing the output of any "black box" function.
One use case is hyper parameter optimization.

Right now, only random search is implemented but many other optimization methods will be added.
Random search and bayesian search is implemented and works well, but there is a lot more to do, including low-hanging fruits such as implementing grid search and other basic search methods.
